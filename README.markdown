# D3: Hiking Data Scatter Plot

A D3 scatter plot connected to a Google Sheet that shows mileage vs elevation gain, top locations visited, and other statistics from my hiking trips in 2021. When the Google Sheet is updated, the graph automatically updates with the new point(s). If the new points do not fit on the graph, the scale adjusts on its own.

This was orginally created as a pen on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/arensmandy/pen/VwpmggN](https://codepen.io/arensmandy/pen/VwpmggN). This is my first time going from CodePen to GitHub; there are still a few things I need to update to make it look right here.

This project was created as a way to practice D3 data vis after going through the freeCodeCamp unit, and as a fun way to keep track of my hiking. I also wanted to learn how to connect Google Sheets to Javascript and practice my CSS skills. In the future I may add pop-up images from the hikes when the user hovers over each point.
