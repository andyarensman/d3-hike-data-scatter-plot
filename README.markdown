# D3: Hiking Data Scatter Plot

A D3 scatter plot connected to a Google Sheet that shows mileage vs elevation gain, top locations visited, and other statistics from my hiking trips in 2021. When the Google Sheet is updated, the graph automatically updates with the new point(s). If the new points do not fit on the graph, the scales adjust on their own. You can see what it looks like below as well as one of the mouseover functions.

# More Info
This was originally created as a pen on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/arensmandy/pen/VwpmggN](https://codepen.io/arensmandy/pen/VwpmggN). This is my first time going from CodePen to GitHub; there are still a few things I need to update to make it look right on GitHub.

The project was created as a way to practice D3 data visualization while going through the [freeCodeCamp certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/), and as a fun way to keep track of my hiking. I also wanted to learn how to connect Google Sheets to Javascript and practice my CSS skills to make a more finished looking graph.

In the future I may add pop-up images from the hikes when the user hovers over each point. I may also make this into a template that others can easily use by simply cloning my Google Sheet, putting in their hiking data, and updating the link in the code that connects to the Google Sheet. This isn't hard to do now, but it could be more user friendly. Finally, I might also try to automate the process of taking the hiking data from the app I use (Map My Run) and putting it into the Google Sheet. This would likely be a separate repository.
