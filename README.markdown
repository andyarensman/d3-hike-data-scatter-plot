# D3: Hiking Data Scatter Plot

A D3 scatter plot connected to a Google Sheet. Shows mileage vs elevation gain, top locations visited, and other statistics from my hiking trips in 2021. When the Google Sheet is updated, the graph automatically updates with the new point(s). If points do not fit in the on the graph, the scale adjusts on its own.
